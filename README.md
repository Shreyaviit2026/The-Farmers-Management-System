The Farm Management System is a web-based platform that streamlines the buying and selling of agricultural products by integrating Pythonâ€™s Flask framework for backend operations and MySQL for database management. Designed for both farmers and buyers, the system allows farmers to register, list products, and interact with customers, while buyers can browse, request quality checks, and make purchases. Automated database triggers ensure secure and traceable transaction logging, enhancing reliability and system integrity. The user-friendly interface, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides accessibility for users with minimal technical expertise. By centralizing data storage and minimizing redundancy, the system offers a scalable, cost-effective solution that supports small-scale farmers, expands market access, and improves transaction efficiency, addressing significant gaps in existing agricultural e-commerce technologies.
